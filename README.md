# Udacity Landing Page Project:

  ***\
  * Manipulating the DOM exercise.
  * Exercise programmatically builds navigation,
  * scrolls to anchors from navigation,
  * and highlights section in viewport upon scrolling.
  \***

This fucked up project is the second project for the Udacity Front End Developer Nano-Degree. It
is supposed to help you learn how to manipulate the DOM. However, their course for this section
doesn't really give you any working examples, it just shows you how to manipulate code that has
already been written. This is great if you want to be a scammer and get Walmart cards from little
old ladies, but not really practical for what they are trying to teach.

As you may or may not be able to see, I have been working on this for more than the time allotted. I
have extended my time by about a month in order to do the JavaScript Basics again and go through
the entire lesson again.

I still don't know where to start, and if you ask in the class forum, they don't really give any
answers except "read the Rubric and suggestions." Fuck you very much, that was no help what-so-ever.
The "Development Strategy" isn't much help either. I swear Udacity likes to set you up to fail.

Ok, so what we are supposed to be doing for this project. I will lay out the entire Rubric for what
needs to be done. Enjoy, and if I actually finish this, anyone is welcome to use whatever part that
will help you. I am going to be writing extensive notes as I go, basically to talk myself through it.

# Udacity Rubric Project 2 - Landing Page

# Interface and Architecture
  * [Architecture](The project should follow Udacity guidelines for file structure)
  * [Usability](All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet and phone browsers)
  * [Styling](Styling has been added for active states)
  * [HTML Structure](There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page)

# Landing Page Behavior
  * [Navigation](Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list)
  * [Section Active State](It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling)
  * [Scroll to Anchor](When clicking a navigation menu item, it should scroll the right section)

# Documentation
  * [README](The ReadMe file should have non-default text in it that is specific to this project)
  * [Comments](Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedure when necessary)
  * [Code Quality](Code will adhere to the Udacity JavaScript Style Guide)
